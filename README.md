# ClientStack

This is one of my final projects for the [CareerDevs Computer Science Academy](http://careerdevs.com/).
The corresponding back end, which was written in Java, can be found at [ClientStackAPI](https://github.com/wiltrahan/client_stackAPI).

## Technolgies Used
* Angular 7
* Angular CLI

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help
